# Everdeep 0.0.1 — Locomotion Foundation

## Implemented

- Camera-relative, smoothly accelerated WASD movement on `CharacterBody3D`.
- Smooth movement-facing rotation, hold-Shift sprint, grounded jumping, Left-Alt dodge burst, gravity, and stable floor contact.
- Airborne movement preserves takeoff momentum and supports separately tunable directional influence.
- Locomotion uses explicit `GROUNDED`, `AIRBORNE`, and `DODGING` states.
- Ordinary graybox stairs use simple ramp collision so stable `CharacterBody3D` locomotion traverses them naturally.
- Mouse orbit camera with independent yaw/pitch, pitch limits, and `SpringArm3D` collision.
- Movement derives its horizontal forward/right basis from the active player camera; only `VisualRoot` rotates, keeping camera orbit independent from character facing.
- Escape releases the mouse; clicking the game recaptures it.
- A lit graybox test arena with floor, walls, camera-collision obstacles, and an elevated block.

## Files

- `res://player/player.tscn` — reusable player scene.
- `res://player/player.gd` — movement, facing, gravity, sprint, and dodge.
- `res://player/player_camera.gd` — camera orbit and mouse capture.
- `res://test/test_arena.tscn` — main development scene.

## Controls

- **W/A/S/D:** move relative to camera yaw
- **Left Shift (hold):** sprint while moving
- **Space:** jump while grounded
- **Left Alt:** dodge in input direction, or facing direction when idle
- **Mouse:** orbit camera
- **Escape / click:** release / recapture mouse

## Inspector tuning

Select the Player root for movement, jump, and dodge values. Select `CameraRig` for sensitivity, distance, pivot height, and pitch limits. Current tuned values remain `walk_speed = 5.0`, `sprint_speed = 8.0`, `jump_velocity = 7.0`, `air_control = 0.4`, and `gravity_multiplier = 1.5`.

The experimental automatic step solver was removed. The player again uses the stable direct `move_and_slide()` locomotion path and default CharacterBody floor/snap settings. In the test arena, ordinary and shallow-wide stair blocks are visual graybox geometry only; each staircase has one hidden convex ramp collider aligned from the arena floor to its top platform. Discrete ledge blocks remain useful jump/blocking tests and are not automatically climbed.

## Locomotion states

- `GROUNDED` follows `CharacterBody3D.is_on_floor()` and handles walk/sprint acceleration and ground deceleration.
- `AIRBORNE` begins on jump or when floor contact is lost and handles reduced air steering without no-input braking.
- `DODGING` begins only from grounded input. When its timer finishes, the controller resolves to `GROUNDED` or `AIRBORNE` from actual floor contact.

Sprint remains a held movement modifier rather than an exclusive state. Jumping is represented by `AIRBORNE`; there is no duplicate `is_grounded`, `is_jumping`, or `is_dodging` flag. Enable `debug_locomotion_transitions` on the Player to log state changes only when they occur. Future traversal states can extend the enum and state dispatch, but none are implemented yet.

## Known limitations

This is intentionally animation-free. Jump has no buffering, coyote time, variable height, or extra jumps. There is no automatic step-up, mantle, or ledge-climb behavior; traversable architectural stairs should use ramp or sufficiently shallow collision. Mouse/keyboard is the only configured input scheme. Camera collision uses the spring arm's default shape.
